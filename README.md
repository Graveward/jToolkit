jToolkit
========

A bunch of classes - tools for Java - OpenGL (fixed function pipeline mostly) programming. I've been programming this during the early stage of my learning. I hope someonewill find all those classes and examples useful. 

## How to Get Started
Simply copy `shader programms` and `classes` into your project. Import them to class(es) that you need to and you're good to go. 

## Notes
* You might see that the author in some places is `Virus`. This is my nickname. Be sure that the code is 100% mine without any copyright issues. 
* The assets were found on the Web as free-to-use. They are used for demostration only purposes. 
* My appologies for lack of comments and proper explanation of what is happening there.
* The main reason for publishing this code was to share some groundwork in OpenGL fixed pipeline which may be useful for some developers or early stage learnerns
