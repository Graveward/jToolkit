jToolkit
========

A bunch of classes - tools for Java - OpenGL (fixed function pipeline mostly) programming. I've been programming this during the early stage of my learning, hope someone will find it useful

## How to Get Started
Simply copy `shader programms` and `classes` into your project. Import them to class(es) that you need to and you're good to go.
