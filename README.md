# jToolkit

# ✍️ About 
A collection of various utilities, classes and shaders for `Java`+`OpenGL`+`GLSL`(fixed function pipeline mostly) programming.  The sources were originally developed for education pusposes and then I decided to open source everything.

# 🏗 How to Get Started
Simply copy-paste `shader programms` and `classes` into your project. Import them to class(es) that you need to and you're good to go. 

# 📝 Notes
* You might see that the author in some places is `Virus`. This is my nickname.
* The used assets were found on the `Web`. *Do not use them for commertial purposes*. They are only used for demostration.
* My appologies for the lack of comments and proper explanation of what going on inside of complex shaders and classes.
* The main reason for publishing this code was to share some groundwork related to `OpenGL's` fixed function pipeline, which may be useful for some developers on early stage learnerns
